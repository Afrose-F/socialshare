SocialShare is a CommonJS Module for Titanium that implements cross-platform sharing of text and images over social networks.

## iOS
On iOS, the module uses the native sharing Action Sheet and offers options for sharing with Facebook and Twitter (if the native apps are installed),
plus AirDrop, Text Message, Email and other built-in iOS mechanisms.

## Android
On Android it uses the Native Sharing Intent, which brings up a list of installed apps to choose from.

## Usage

If you want to send an image, set the image property to the Native Path to the image.  If you wish to only send text, simply don't send the image property.
```javascript
require('com.alcoapps.socialshare').share({
	status 					: 'This is the status to share',
	image 					: fileToShare.nativePath,
	androidDialogTitle 		: 'Sharing is caring!!!'
})
```

**BOOM!  That's it!  You're sharing!**

## Dependencies
This module requires dk.napp.social for iOS which you can get from [https://github.com/viezel/TiSocial.Framework](https://github.com/viezel/TiSocial.Framework)


## Why more sharing options on Android

Because Android is awesome!

No, really.  The reason is because the "sharing intent" is a method "baked" into the Android SDK, so you simply call it with the data you want to share, and Android will return the installed apps that can handle that type of data.  iOS on the other hand offers some built-in methods, but others need to be added by native code.  The dk.napp.social module does just that, but only for Twitter, Facebook and Weibo (which is only relevant for China users).

## Get it
You can get it from the [/app/lib](https://github.com/ricardoalcocer/socialshare/tree/master/app/lib) folder.
